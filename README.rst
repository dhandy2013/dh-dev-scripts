dh-dev-scripts README
=====================

This repository is for helper scripts for software development and
deployment, that may be useful for more than one project, or that may
contain code I wish to adapt and reuse later.

* classname_size.py -- Gather statistics on classes in a Python source tree
* mysql_dump_dbs.py -- Dump a set of MySQL databases using wildcards
